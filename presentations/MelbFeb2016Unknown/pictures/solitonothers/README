The experiment here has two solitons both of amplitude 0.96m on top of still water 1m deep. The one of the left travels with positive velocity and is centered at 150m while the one on the right travels with negative velocity and is centered at 250m. This happens on a domain from 0.0 to 400m for 150 seconds. 

\Delta x = 0.01
\Delta t = 0.1 * \Delta x

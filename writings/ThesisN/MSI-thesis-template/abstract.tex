Recent research in numerical wave modelling has focused on developing computational methods for solving non-linear dispersive wave equations as an extension to methods solving the non-linear shallow water wave equations. By including extra terms that allow for dispersion these equations more accurately model water waves than the shallow water wave equations. An interesting example of these non-linear dispersive equations for modelling water waves are the Serre equations. 

In this work an efficient and robust numerical method for the one-dimensional Serre equations was developed. This method uses a finite element method to solve an elliptic equation and a finite volume method to solve the remaining conservation equations and is hence termed the Finite Element Volume Method (FEVM). The use of a finite element method and a finite volume method makes the FEVM adaptable to unstructured meshes and parallelisable. The FEVM recovers the lake at rest steady state and accurately simulates flows over dry beds.

The convergence and dispersion properties of the FEVM were determined using a linear analysis. The FEVM was validated against analytic and forced solutions of the Serre equations, demonstrating its convergence and conservation properties. Finally, the method was validated against experimental data for a wide array of physical scenarios, establishing its utility as a realistic model.

All these analyses and validations were also conducted on other methods allowing comparisons between them and the FEVM. The FEVM was found to be the most robust of these methods whilst being adequately accurate. Since the FEVM can be extended to unstructured meshes with parallelised code it is the most promising of the studied methods for solving the Serre equations in two dimensions.

Recent research in numerical wave modelling has focused on developing computational methods for solving non-linear, dispersive wave equations as an extension to the well understood computational methods for solving the nonlinear shallow water wave equations. These equations contain extra terms that allow for dispersion; better modelling the behaviour of actual water waves. An interesting example of these nonlinear dispersive equations from the viewpoint of modelling water waves are the Serre equations; striking a balance between its accuracy as a model for water waves and the computational expense required to solve it as compared to the shallow water wave equations. 

In this work an efficient and robust numerical method for the one-dimensional Serre equations was developed. This method uses a consistent polynomial representation of the solution over the cells to approximate the Serre equations which makes it suitable for unstructured meshes and parrallelisable. This method was extended to allow for the recovery of the lake at rest steady state and the simulation of flow over dry beds.  

The convergence and dispersion properties of the method was determined using a linear analysis. The method was validated against analytic and forced solutions of the Serre equations, demonstrating its convergence properties. Finally, it was validated against experimental data for a wide array of physical scenarios, establishing its utility as a physical model. All these analyses and validations were conducted whilst comparing the method to previous methods to demonstrate its strengths and weaknesses. Overall the developed method was found to be the most robust whilst being adequately accurate and is therefore the preferred numerical method for the Serre equations.

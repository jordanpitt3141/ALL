Recent research in numerical wave modelling has focused on developing computational methods for solving non-linear, dispersive wave equations as an extension to methods solving the non-linear shallow water wave equations. These equations contain extra terms that allow for dispersion; improving its modelling capabilities for water waves. An interesting example of these non-linear dispersive equations for modelling water waves are the Serre equations. 

In this work an efficient and robust numerical method for the one-dimensional Serre equations was developed. This method uses a finite element method to solve an elliptic equation and a finite volume method to solve the remaining conservation equations and is hence termed the Finite Element Volume Method (FEVM). The use of a finite element method and a finite volume method makes the FEVM adaptable to unstructured meshes and parrallelisable. The FEVM allows for the recovery of the lake at rest steady state and the simulation of flow over dry beds.

The convergence and dispersion properties of the FEVM was determined using a linear analysis. The FEVM was validated against analytic and forced solutions of the Serre equations, demonstrating its convergence properties. Finally, it was validated against experimental data for a wide array of physical scenarios, establishing its utility as a realistic model.

All these analyses and validations were also conducted on other methods allowing comparisons between them and the FEVM. Overall the FEVM was found to be the most robust whilst being adequately accurate and is therefore, the recommended approach for solving the Serre equations.

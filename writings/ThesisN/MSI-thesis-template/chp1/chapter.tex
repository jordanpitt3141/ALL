\section{Objectives of the Thesis}
%Method that:
%Extends well to 2D and triangular meshes and can calculate all terms in flux locally after reconstruction
%
%Can handle steep gradients
%
%Can handle dry beds
%Perform a full linear analysis of the metho


\section{Original Contribution of the Thesis}

%Steep gradient review of literature and new result
%full linear analysis
%Serre model with dry beds validated against forced solutions and experiments

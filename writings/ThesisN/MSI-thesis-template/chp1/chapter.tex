A significant portion of the world's people and critical infrastructure is located near the coast, with shipping being the dominant method of trade in our globalised world. While the ocean provides many opportunities it also poses significant hazards for instance; tsunamis and storm surges. Furthermore, the dynamics of ocean waves significantly impacts our understanding of other physical phenomena; such as the breakup of sea-ice and the erosion of beaches. Therefore, accurate modelling of ocean waves is important to our society. 

The physics of water is well understood being an application of Newtons second law; with their governing partial differential equations being written down very early on by \citet{Euler-1755-274}. These were then extended to allow for viscosity, producing the full Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical methods \cite{Chorin-1967-928,Taylor-Hood-1973-73,Bassi-1997-267} have been developed to solve these full water equations; however due to the complexity of these partial differential equations such methods can only accurately resolve fluid behaviour over small scales and not the scale required to model a tsunami over an ocean basin. 

For this reason the central focus of water wave modelling has been simplified water wave theories that approximate the behaviour of the free surface of water governed by the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. The most popular class of these approximate water wave theories are the shallow water wave theories where the characteristic water depth $h_0$ is far smaller than the characteristic wave length $\lambda_0$. So that $\sigma = h_0 / \lambda_0 \le 1$. If we neglect all terms of order $\mathcal{O}\left(\sigma ^2\right)$ then the full Euler equations reduce to the Shallow Water Wave Equations (SWWE) which describe fully nonlinear non-dispersive waves. Retaining higher powers of $\sigma$ leads to a class of equations known as `Boussinesq-type' equations. Boussinesq-type equations are then classified by the powers of $\sigma$ they retain and their nonlinearity; which is based on their assumption on the size of $\epsilon= a_0 / h_0$ which measures the characteristic amplitude of the waves $a_0$ against $h_0$. These wave models form a spectrum with the SWWE being the simplest and most restrictive model and the Boussinesq-type models retaining the highest powers of $\sigma$ and largest $\epsilon$ being the most complex and least restrictive. The Serre equations are one particular Boussniesq-type equation that retains all terms of order $\mathcal{O}\left(\sigma ^4\right)$ and makes no assumption of the size of $\epsilon$ and is thus the best model for water waves for the $\mathcal{O}\left(\sigma ^4\right)$ class of Boussinesq-type equations. 

There has previously been a significant amount of research into developing large scale, efficient and robust computational methods for the SWWE []. However, due to the neglect of all terms of order $\mathcal{O}\left(\sigma ^2\right)$ in the Euler equations the SWWE do not capture all water wave behaviour; in particular dispersion. Recent research \cite{Grue-etal-2008-113,Kirby-etal-2013-39} has highlighted the need for dispersive wave models for the evolution of tsunamis. For the purposes of ocean wave modelling the Serre equations are the best placed \cite{Bonneton-Lannes-2009-16601}; retaining high-order $\sigma$ terms and allowing for any size of $\epsilon$. Hence the overarching goal of our research is the development of large-scale, efficient and robust computational models for the Serre equations for the purposes of ocean wave modelling.



\section{Objectives of the Thesis}
%Method that:
%Extends well to 2D and triangular meshes and can calculate all terms in flux locally after reconstruction
%
%Can handle steep gradients
%
%Can handle dry beds
%Perform a full linear analysis of the methods


In view of the overarching goal, the primary motivation of this thesis was the development of a numerical method for the one-dimensional Serre equations that is robust to steep gradients in the free surface and dry beds and can be readily extended to the two dimensional Serre equations using unstructured meshes. 

This was achieved through the development of previously described methods in the literature; particularly those of \citet{Zoppou-2014}. These method were extended, by allowing them to adequately handle dry beds and replacing their finite difference method with a finite element method making the method more suitable for unstructured meshes. 

This method was then assessed with a linear analysis, a validation against analytic and forced solutions and finally with a validation against experimental results. At all stages of this assessment the method is compared to at least one other method; demonstrating its strengths and weaknesses. Overall, the method is found to be superior to the others and possesses all the desirable properties constituting the main goal of the Thesis.

\section{Organisation of the Thesis}
The thesis proceeds by presenting the one-dimensional Serre equations in conservation law form with a source term, describing their dispersion and conservation properties and then summarising the main results of my investigation into the behaviour of the Serre equations in the presence of steep gradients in the free surface \cite{Pitt-2018-61}.

This is followed by Chapter \ref{chp:HFVMMethod} which describes in detail the developed method. In this thesis the results of other numerical methods are also provided; descriptions of these methods can be found in the literature \cite{Zoppou-etal-2017,Pitt-2018-61}. However, since the developed method is the preferred method only its description is provided in this thesis. 

Chapter \ref{chp:AnalNumMethod} provides an linear analysis of the convergence and dispersion properties of the developed finite element and volume method in detail. The analysis begins with the linearised Serre equations over a horizontal bed and then derives the evolution matrix; from which the convergence and dispersion properties of the methods can be studied. The results of the linear analysis are also provided for all the methods used by \citet{Pitt-2018-61}.

The convergence and conservation properties of the numerical methods of \citet{Pitt-2018-61} are then assessed in Chapter \ref{chp:NumMethodComp} using analytic and forced solutions of the Serre equations. While Chapter \ref{chp:ExpMethodComp} validates the numerical method against experimental results.

Finally, Chapter \ref{chp:Conclusion} summarises the major contributions and findings of the Thesis and presents a summary of the future work for further development of this method.

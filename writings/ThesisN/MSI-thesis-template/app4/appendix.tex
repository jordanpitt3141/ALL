We demonstrate a numerical approach for solving the one-dimensional non-linear weakly dispersive Serre equations. By introducing a new conserved quantity the Serre equations can be written in conservation law form, where the velocity is recovered from the conserved quantities at each time step by solving an auxiliary elliptic equation. Numerical techniques for solving equations in conservative law form can then be applied to solve the	Serre equations. We demonstrate how this is achieved. The system of conservation equations are solved using the finite volume method and the associated elliptic equation for the velocity is solved using a finite difference method. This robust approach allows us to accurately solve problems with steep gradients in the flow, such as those generated by discontinuities in the initial conditions.

The method is shown to be accurate, simple to implement and stable for a range of problems including flows with steep gradients and variable bathymetry.

A tsunami has four main stages of its evolution; in the first stage the tsunami is generated, most commonly by seismic activity near subduction zones. The second stage is the tsunamis propagation through the ocean far from the coast, where variation in bathymetry is slight and gradual. The third stage is the shoaling and interaction of the tsunami with bathymetry as it approaches the coastline. Finally the tsunami reaches and inundates the shore. For our purposes the hydrodynamic models we are interested in deal with the final three stages of the evolution of a tsunami.

The propagation of a tsunami with wavelength $\lambda$ through water that is $H$ deep is well understood when $\lambda / H \le 1/ 20$, which we call shallow water as noted by Sorensen (2006). The wavelengths for tsunamis range from a few to hundreds of kilometres, while the maximum water depth is $11km$ at the Marianas trench, so that most tsunamis occur in shallow water. This stage of tsunami behaviour is adequately modelled using the shallow water wave equations. Current research into tsunamis focuses around more complex approximations to the Euler equations for the third and fourth stages. In this paper we focused on the Serre equations as they are considered a very good model for fluid behaviour up to the shoreline, and they reduce to the shallow water wave equations for large wavelengths. 

Although more complicated, the Serre equations provide a better description of the fluid behaviour than the shallow water wave equations and are therefore more computationally expensive to solve numerically. In particular for the methods of this work, we find that the Serre equations have a run-time $50\%$ longer than our equivalent finite volume method for the shallow water wave equations in the one dimensional case. To simulate tsunamis as efficiently as possible it is important to know when using the more complicated Serre equations leads to more accurate predictions of the evolution of a tsunami than the shallow water wave equations. To investigate this we have numerically simulated a laboratory experiment of periodic waves propagating over a submerged bar, and the propagation of a small amplitude wave up a gradual linear slope using both the Serre and the shallow water wave equations.

The results of these simulations demonstrated that the Serre and shallow water wave equations produce similar results for shoaling waves when the wavelength is large compared to the water depth. This is not surprising as this is the regime under which the shallow water wave equations are derived. However, outside this regime the shallow water wave equations are a poor model for wave shoaling and propagation, poorly approximating the shape and maximum height of waves. Furthermore we demonstrate that for steep waves generated by shoaling, the shallow water wave equations can underestimate the arrival time and amplitude of an incoming wave. These results suggest that for a tsunami it is sufficient to use the shallow water wave equations in stages two and some of stage three, even for large changes in bathymetry. Although dispersive equations such as the Serre equations are required to accurately capture fluid behaviour in stages three and four nearer to the coastline, particularly when wavelengths are short or waves are steep. Since the Serre equations represent only a moderate increase in run-times this suggests that our inundation models should be based on them.

We use numerical methods to study the short term behaviour of the Serre equations in
the presence of steep gradients because there are no known analytical solutions for these
problems. In keeping with the literature we study a class of initial condition problems that
are a smooth approximation to the initial conditions of the dam-break problem. This class
of initial condition problems allow us to observe the behaviour of the Serre equations
with varying steepness of the initial conditions. The numerical solutions of the Serre
equations are justified by demonstrating that as the resolution increases they converge
to a solution with little error in conservation of mass, momentum and energy independent
of the numerical method. We observe and justify four different structures of the converged
numerical solutions depending on the steepness of the initial conditions. Two of these
structures were observed in the literature, with the other two not being commonly found
in the literature. The numerical solutions are then used to assess how well the analytical
solution of the shallow water wave equations captures the mean behaviour of the solution
of the Serre equations for the dam-break problem in the short term. Lastly the numerical
solutions are compared to asymptotic results in the literature to approximate the depth
and location of the front of an undular bore.

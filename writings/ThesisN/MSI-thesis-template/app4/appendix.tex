\noindent\textbf{Abstract:}

The nonlinear and weakly dispersive Serre equations contain higher-order dispersive terms. These include mixed spatial and temporal derivative flux terms which are difficult to handle numerically. These terms can be replaced by an alternative combination of equivalent temporal and spatial terms, so that the Serre equations can be written in conservation law form. The water depth and new conserved quantities are evolved using a second-order finite-volume scheme. The remaining primitive variable, the depth-averaged horizontal velocity, is obtained by solving a second-order elliptic equation using simple finite differences. Using an analytical solution and simulating the dam-break problem, the proposed scheme is shown to be accurate, simple to implement and stable for a range of problems, including flows with steep gradients. It is only slightly more computationally expensive than solving the shallow water wave equations.

\noindent\textbf{My Contribution:}

I reproduced the results of my coauthors with my own implementation of the method. This method was consistent with a SWWE solver allowing the computational cost of solving the Serre equations and the SWWE to be compared.

	\noindent\textbf{Relevance to Thesis:}
	
	The method described in this paper was extended to allow for varying bathymetry \cite{Zoppou-etal-2017} and dry beds during my research. Resulting in the second-order finite difference volume method reported in the thesis. Since the linear analysis of convergence and dispersion properties is performed for a submerged horizontal bed, the results of the linear analysis for both methods are equivalent. These linear results can be found in Chapter \ref{chp:AnalNumMethod} and Appendix \ref{app:LinAnal}. The extended version of the method was validated against analytic and forced solutions in Chapter \ref{chp:NumMethodComp} and compared to experimental results in Chapter \ref{chp:ExpMethodComp}.

\noindent\textbf{Abstract:}

We demonstrate a numerical approach for solving the one-dimensional non-linear weakly dispersive Serre equations. By introducing a new conserved quantity the Serre equations can be written in conservation law form, where the velocity is recovered from the conserved quantities at each time step by solving an auxiliary elliptic equation. Numerical techniques for solving equations in conservative law form can then be applied to solve the	Serre equations. We demonstrate how this is achieved. The system of conservation equations are solved using the finite volume method and the associated elliptic equation for the velocity is solved using a finite difference method. This robust approach allows us to accurately solve problems with steep gradients in the flow, such as those generated by discontinuities in the initial conditions.

The method is shown to be accurate, simple to implement and stable for a range of problems including flows with steep gradients and variable bathymetry.

	\noindent\textbf{My Contribution:}
	
	The methods, linear dispersion analysis and numerical solutions were all produced by me; these results were then written up into this paper by my coauthors.

	\noindent\textbf{Relevance to Thesis:}
	
	The first-, second- and third-order methods described in this paper are the methods whose results are reported in the thesis. The results of a linear analysis of the dispersion and convergence properties of all these methods are provided in Chapter \ref{chp:AnalNumMethod} and Appendix \ref{app:LinAnal}. The linear analysis of dispersion presented in this paper was extended to allow for a mean background flow in the water on which the waves occur. The results of the analytic solution validation in this paper are reproduced in Chapter \ref{chp:NumMethodComp}. This validation was extended to study the convergence and conservation properties of more quantities. The second-order finite difference volume method was then validated against forced solutions in Chapter \ref{chp:NumMethodComp} and experimental results in Chapter \ref{chp:ExpMethodComp}. The experimental results of the second-order finite difference volume method for the evolution of a negative rectangular wave \cite{Hammack-Segur-1978-337} and periodic waves over a submerged bar \cite{Beji-Battjes-1994-1} in this paper are reproduced in the thesis.

\textbf{Abstract:}

A tsunami has four main stages of its evolution; in the first stage the tsunami is generated, most commonly by seismic activity near subduction zones. The second stage is the tsunamis propagation through the ocean far from the coast, where variation in bathymetry is slight and gradual. The third stage is the shoaling and interaction of the tsunami with bathymetry as it approaches the coastline. Finally the tsunami reaches and inundates the shore. For our purposes the hydrodynamic models we are interested in deal with the final three stages of the evolution of a tsunami.

The propagation of a tsunami with wavelength $\lambda$ through water that is $H$ deep is well understood when $\lambda / H \le 1/ 20$, which we call shallow water as noted by Sorensen (2006). The wavelengths for tsunamis range from a few to hundreds of kilometres, while the maximum water depth is $11km$ at the Marianas trench, so that most tsunamis occur in shallow water. This stage of tsunami behaviour is adequately modelled using the shallow water wave equations. Current research into tsunamis focuses around more complex approximations to the Euler equations for the third and fourth stages. In this paper we focused on the Serre equations as they are considered a very good model for fluid behaviour up to the shoreline, and they reduce to the shallow water wave equations for large wavelengths. 

Although more complicated, the Serre equations provide a better description of the fluid behaviour than the shallow water wave equations and are therefore more computationally expensive to solve numerically. In particular for the methods of this work, we find that the Serre equations have a run-time $50\%$ longer than our equivalent finite volume method for the shallow water wave equations in the one dimensional case. To simulate tsunamis as efficiently as possible it is important to know when using the more complicated Serre equations leads to more accurate predictions of the evolution of a tsunami than the shallow water wave equations. To investigate this we have numerically simulated a laboratory experiment of periodic waves propagating over a submerged bar, and the propagation of a small amplitude wave up a gradual linear slope using both the Serre and the shallow water wave equations.

The results of these simulations demonstrated that the Serre and shallow water wave equations produce similar results for shoaling waves when the wavelength is large compared to the water depth. This is not surprising as this is the regime under which the shallow water wave equations are derived. However, outside this regime the shallow water wave equations are a poor model for wave shoaling and propagation, poorly approximating the shape and maximum height of waves. Furthermore we demonstrate that for steep waves generated by shoaling, the shallow water wave equations can underestimate the arrival time and amplitude of an incoming wave. These results suggest that for a tsunami it is sufficient to use the shallow water wave equations in stages two and some of stage three, even for large changes in bathymetry. Although dispersive equations such as the Serre equations are required to accurately capture fluid behaviour in stages three and four nearer to the coastline, particularly when wavelengths are short or waves are steep. Since the Serre equations represent only a moderate increase in run-times this suggests that our inundation models should be based on them.

\textbf{Abstract:}

We use numerical methods to study the short term behaviour of the Serre equations in
the presence of steep gradients because there are no known analytical solutions for these
problems. In keeping with the literature we study a class of initial condition problems that
are a smooth approximation to the initial conditions of the dam-break problem. This class
of initial condition problems allow us to observe the behaviour of the Serre equations
with varying steepness of the initial conditions. The numerical solutions of the Serre
equations are justified by demonstrating that as the resolution increases they converge
to a solution with little error in conservation of mass, momentum and energy independent
of the numerical method. We observe and justify four different structures of the converged
numerical solutions depending on the steepness of the initial conditions. Two of these
structures were observed in the literature, with the other two not being commonly found
in the literature. The numerical solutions are then used to assess how well the analytical
solution of the shallow water wave equations captures the mean behaviour of the solution
of the Serre equations for the dam-break problem in the short term. Lastly the numerical
solutions are compared to asymptotic results in the literature to approximate the depth
and location of the front of an undular bore.

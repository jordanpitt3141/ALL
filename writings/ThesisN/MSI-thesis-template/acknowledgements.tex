I would like to thank my lead supervisor Professor Stephen Roberts for his insight, suggestions and time spent improving my research. Additionally, I would also like to thank Dr Chris Zoppou who put a tremendous amount of time and effort into reading and editing my work. Furthermore, I want to thank the remainder of my supervisory panel Professor Markus Hegland and Professor John Urbas.

I would also like to thank fellow researchers who provided their experimental data:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dr David George, Cascades Volcano Observatory, U.S. Geological Survey for providing the digitised data for the negative rectangular wave experiment.
	\item Professor Sedar Beji, Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Istanbul Technical University for providing the data for the periodic waves over a submerged bar experiment.
	\item Dr Volker Roeber, Department of Physical Oceanography, University of Hawai`i at M\={a}noa for providing the data for the solitary wave over a fringing reef experiment.
\end{itemize}

Finally, I extend my thanks to my dear friend Joseph Gibson who donated a computer that hosted many numerical experiments.

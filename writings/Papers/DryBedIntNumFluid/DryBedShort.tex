\abstract[Summary]{
 	We describe a numerical method for solving the Serre equations that can model flows over dry bathymetry. The method solves the Serre equations in conservation law form with a finite volume method. A finite element method is used to solve the auxiliary elliptic equation for the depth-averaged horizontal velocity. The numerical method is validated against the lake at rest analytic solution, demonstrating that it is well-balanced. The method is further validated and its convergence rate established using forced solutions containing the wetting and drying of bathymetry. The use of forced solutions extends previous validations performed for Serre equation solvers for flows over dry bathymetry. Finally, the method is validated against experimental results for the run-up of a solitary wave on a sloped beach.

\section{Elliptic Equation}
The linearised elliptic equation is

\[G = Hu - \frac{H^3}{3}u_{xx}\]

Want to find out the FEM approximation to this $G'$ such that

\[G' = \mathcal{G}_{FE_1} u\]

for $P^1$ FEM

\[G' = \mathcal{G}_{FE_2} u\]

for $P^2$ FEM.

To do so we begin by first multiplying by an arbitrary test function $v$ so that

\[Gv = Huv - \frac{H^3}{3}u_{xx}v\]

and then we integrate over the entire domain to get 
\[\int_\Omega Gv dx = \int_\Omega Huv dx - \int_\Omega \frac{H^3}{3}u_{xx}vdx\]

for all $v$

We then make use of integration by parts, with Dirchlet boundaries to get

\[\int_\Omega Gv dx = \int_\Omega Huv dx + \int_\Omega \frac{H^3}{3}u_{x}v_xdx\]

Our FVM discretisation already has a natrual structure with linear functions intervals of like $[x_{j- 1/2} , x_{j+1/2}]$

So we can reformulate this as 

\[\sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} Gv dx = \sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} Huv dx + \sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} \frac{H^3}{3}u_{xx}vdx\]

or more aptly

\[\sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} Gv dx - \int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} Huv dx - \int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} \frac{H^3}{3}u_{xx}vdx = 0 \]

for all v

\[\sum_{j}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} Gv dx - H\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} uv dx -  \frac{H^3}{3}\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}}u_{xx}vdx = 0 \]
